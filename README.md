<h2 align = "center">Solidity Basic Projects</h2>

In this repo you can learn some basic projects in Solidity.

## 1. Simple Calculator

### Description
A Solidity contract that implements basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Features
- Functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Error handling for division by zero.

### Implementation
- Solidity smart contract with functions for arithmetic operations.
- Tests for each arithmetic operation to ensure correctness.

### Usage
1. Deploy the Solidity contract.
2. Call the respective functions to perform arithmetic operations.

## 2. Lottery

### Description
A Solidity smart contract that simulates a lottery system where participants can buy tickets, and a winner is randomly selected among them.

### Features
- Ability for participants to buy tickets with Ether.
- Random selection of a winner.
- Winner receiving the prize pool.

### Implementation
- Solidity smart contract with functions for buying tickets, selecting a winner, and distributing prizes.
- Randomness implemented using a combination of block variables and external oracles.

### Usage
1. Deploy the Lottery contract.
2. Participants buy tickets by sending Ether to the contract.
3. Admin can call the function to select a winner.
4. Winner claims the prize.

## 3. To-Do Lists

### Description
A Solidity smart contract for managing a simple to-do list where users can add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.

### Features
- Add tasks to the to-do list.
- Remove tasks from the to-do list.
- Mark tasks as completed.

### Implementation
- Solidity smart contract with functions for adding, removing, and completing tasks.
- Storage for maintaining the state of tasks.

### Usage
1. Deploy the To-Do Lists contract.
2. Users add tasks to the list, remove tasks.
3. Interact with the contract to manage the to-do list.

## Conclusion

These projects provide a hands-on approach to learning Solidity and blockchain development. Feel free to modify and expand upon them as you explore more advanced topics.
